# GNSS evaluation board firmware

![](https://www.gabrielecalabrese.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_8391.jpeg)
This repository contains the firmware for the GNSS evaluation board, based on the uBlox MAX-M10S module. The project is developed using ESP-IDF with Eclipse for the ESP32-S3. It includes I2C communication setup, NMEA data parsing, and example code for displaying parsed data. This is a starting point with basic functionality and can be extended with additional features, error checks, and more parsing functions.

For the hardware design, refer to [Part 1 of the blog post](https://www.gabrielecalabrese.com/2024/05/19/build-a-gnss-evaluation-board-part-1/). Detailed firmware description can be found in [Part 2](https://www.gabrielecalabrese.com/2024/05/23/build-a-gnss-evaluation-board-part-2/).
